11) Write a C program to check whether a given number is even or odd using bitwise operators.


*Input: Read the integer number.

*Check the least significant bit:

*Use the bitwise AND operator (&) to check the least significant bit of the number.

If the result is 1 (i.e., number & 1 == 1), the number is odd.

*Otherwise, the number is even.

*Output: Display whether the number is even or odd.
