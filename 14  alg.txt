14) Write a C program to check whether a given number is a power of two or not, using bitwise operators.




*Input: Read the integer number.

*Check if the number is greater than 0.

*Perform bitwise operation:

*If the number is a power of two, it should have exactly one set bit (1) in its binary representation.

*Use the bitwise AND operator to check if number & (number - 1) equals 0.

*Output: If the result is 0, the number is a power of two; otherwise, it is not.
