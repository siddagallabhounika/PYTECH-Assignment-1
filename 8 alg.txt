8)Write a C program that takes two integers as input and swaps their values without using a third variable.



*Start the program.

*Declare two integer variables.

*Read the values of the two integers from the user.

*Swap the values of the two integers without using a third variable:

Step 4.1: a = a + b

Step 4.2: b = a - b

Step 4.3: a = a - b

*Print the swapped values of the two integers to the console.

*End the program.
