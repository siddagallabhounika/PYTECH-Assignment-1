19)  Write a C program to check if a given year is a leap year or not using logical operators.
  

*Input: Read the year.

*Check if the year is a leap year:

*A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.

However, if the year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400.

*Output: If the year meets the above conditions, it is a leap year; otherwise, it is not.
