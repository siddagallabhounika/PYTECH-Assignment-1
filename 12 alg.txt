12) Write a C program to perform bitwise AND, OR, XOR, operations on two given integers.



*Input: Read two integer numbers, num1 and num2.

*Perform bitwise operations:

Calculate AND_result as num1 & num2.

Calculate OR_result as num1 | num2.

Calculate XOR_result as num1 ^ num2.

*Output: Display the results of the bitwise operations.
